Java script assignment 1 :  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Write a program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not.
2. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius,
Fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in
Fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 °F
45°F is 7.222222222222222°C
3. Write a program to find the factorial of a number


Javascript Assignment 2 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a Javascript function to check whether a triangle is equilateral,
isosceles or scalene
2. Write a function using switch case to find the grade of a student based
on marks obtained
a. “S grade” if the marks are between 90 and 100.
b. “A grade” if the marks are between 80 and 90.
c. “B grade” if the marks are between 70 and 80.
d. “C grade” if the marks are between 60 and 70.
e. “D grade” if the marks are between 50 and 60.
f. “E grade” if the marks are between 40 and 50.
g. “Student has failed” if the marks are between 0 and 40.
h. Else output “Invalid marks”.
3. Write a JavaScript program to find the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5
under 1000
4. Write a program to find the factorial of all prime numbers between a
given range . Range will be passed as 2 values in the function
parameters. eg- if it is needed to find the values for numbers 1-100, then
function declaration can look like - function prime(1,100)


Javascript Assignment 3 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Using for loops, write a Javascript program to output the following
pattern -
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
2. Write a program to find whether a given number is armstrong number or
notThe Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of
its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong
numbers. Let's try to understand why 153 is an Armstrong number.
153 = (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3) where:
(1*1*1)=1
(5*5*5)=125
(3*3*3)=27
So:
1+125+27=153
3. Write a program to find whether a given number is special number or
notIf the sum of the factorial of digits of a number (N) is equal to the
number itself, the number (N) is called a special number.
eg- 145 is a special number
Logic- 1! + 4! + 5!= 1+24+120 i.e 145

Javascript Assignment 4 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This assignment will help you interpret mathematical relationships both
algebraically and geometrically.
Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the
number of matchsticks in that step. See step 1, 2 and 3 in the image above.
Take input from the user in the function parameter and return the output
using the return statement.
examplesmatchHouses(1) ➞ 6
matchHouses(4) ➞ 21
matchHouses(87) ➞ 43

Javascript Assignment 5 : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder, Sphere and
Cone with four decimal places using objects and classes.
Create classes for volumes for each geometric shape which returns the
output using the getVolume() method.
eg- to get volume of cylinderlet obj= new Cylinder(radius,height);
obj.getVolume();
Formulas for volumes of the shapes1) Cylinder- Volume = πr
2h
where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
2)Sphere- Volume= 4/3π𝑟
3
where r is the radius
3) Cone- Volume= πr
2h/3
where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.
